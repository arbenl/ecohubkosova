# Architecture Plan (2025 React Native + Supabase Readiness)

This document tracks the restructuring blueprint we agreed to while preparing EcoHub Kosova for a shared web + React Native codebase.

## 1. Security & Auth Hardening

- ✅ Centralized admin checks (`lib/auth/roles.ts`) ensure every privileged server action verifies the canonical `users` record rather than trusting JWT metadata.
- ✅ Updated `scripts/02-setup-rls.sql` introduces `public.is_admin()` and rewritten policies so Postgres enforces the same constraints.
- ✅ Auth flows (login/registration) now use shared validators (`src/validation/auth.ts`).
- 🔜 Apply the new SQL to Supabase (if not already done) and expand the helper pattern to other flows (profile/admin dashboards).

## 2. Server‑Driven Data Layers

- ✅ Drejtoria, Qendra e Dijes, Tregu, and dashboard stats now fetch strictly on the server via `src/services/*`.
- ✅ Client shells (e.g., `app/drejtoria/drejtoria-client-page.tsx`) only handle filters/pagination and mutate URL state.
- ✅ Profile + admin CRUD flows now route through `src/services` (including the new `src/services/admin/*` helpers), so server actions stay thin and React Native can reuse the same logic.

## 3. Shared Validation

- ✅ Zod schemas now back all auth, listing creation, profile/organization updates, and every admin CRUD screen (`src/validation/{auth,listings,profile,admin}.ts`); server actions and client forms both reuse the sanitized payloads.

## 4. Testing & CI

- ✅ `pnpm build` / `pnpm lint` run clean; Playwright specs were updated to match current copy (6 scenarios pass on an unrestricted machine).
- 🔜 Re-enable Playwright in an environment where Next.js can bind to a port; add Vitest + React Testing Library for unit/component coverage and wire everything into CI.

## 5. React Native Readiness

- ✅ Service/validation layers now offer framework-agnostic entry points.
- 🔜 Once the remaining flows are extracted, expose them via route handlers / shared SDKs that an RN client (or future API consumers) can call directly.

## 6. Tooling & Code Organization

- ✅ Database migrations now live under `supabase/migrations/**` (managed with the Supabase CLI) and seeds in `supabase/seed.sql`, replacing the legacy `/scripts` SQL.
- ✅ Drizzle ORM powers the admin service layer via the Supabase Postgres connection string, giving us typed queries without sacrificing the Supabase auth checks executed in server actions.
- ✅ All application code now lives under `src/**` (`src/app`, `src/components`, `src/hooks`, `src/lib`, `src/services`, `src/validation`), giving RN and future SDKs a single import root.

## Current Work Branch

- `feat/next-steps` — focus on migrating the remaining Supabase usage into `src/services` and expanding the Zod validator coverage.

## Next Priorities

1. ✅ Document and enforce the new `src/**`-only layout across generators (shadcn config, new modules, docs) so future code never drifts back to the root.
2. Re-enable Playwright and introduce Vitest + React Testing Library so unit/component suites run locally and in CI.
3. Publish the service layer via typed route handlers / SDK endpoints for React Native and other consumers once the above refactors land.
4. Investigate and harden the lingering cross-session sign-out issue once the above foundational work is complete.
5. Wire Supabase migrations into CI (db reset/lint) so schema drift is caught automatically.
