# Baseline Audits — 2025-12-02

- **i18n_audit**: SUCCESS; 68 findings. Major buckets: missing translations across about/admin/admin-users/admin-workspace/auth/common/contact/cta/dashboard (stats/title/CTA strings), plus low-priority hardcoded Albanian strings in auth success page and admin articles table.
- **navigation_audit**: SUCCESS; 55 routes analyzed, 0 issues reported.

Notes:

- Footer locale discrepancy still needs reproduction against /en/how-it-works (script vs manual).
- Next step: reproduce footer mismatch, validate audit findings, and add browser-level check.
