MCP USAGE (MANDATORY)

You have two MCP servers available in this workspace:

1) mcp-context-server
   - Tools: project_map, code_search, read_files
   - Scope: always target the EcoHub Kosova repo.
   - How to work:
     - BEFORE proposing any code changes, first:
       - Run project_map to understand the structure.
       - Use code_search to find the relevant files/identifiers.
       - Use read_files to inspect the exact file contents you plan to edit.
     - Never guess file paths or contents – always confirm via these tools.

2) ecohub-qa
   - Tools: build_health, tests_orchestrator, auth_audit, navigation_audit, runtime_log_scan, etc.
   - How to work:
     - AFTER you propose or apply changes, choose the relevant QA tool(s):
       - Always run build_health to ensure lint, tsc, and build pass.
       - For E2E-related work, run tests_orchestrator or specific test commands where appropriate.
     - Use the QA results to decide if further fixes are needed.

Workflow requirement:
- Every time you start a new task:
  1) Use mcp-context-server (project_map + code_search + read_files) to gather real context.
  2) Then propose COMPLETE, ready-to-paste code changes.
  3) Then use ecohub-qa tools to validate (at least build_health).
  4) Finally, write a short REPORT summarizing what you did and what the QA tools reported.
