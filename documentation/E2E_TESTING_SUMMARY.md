# ecohubkosova E2E Auth Testing - Summary & Getting Started

## What Was Created

I've set up a comprehensive E2E testing suite for your ecohubkosova authentication flow. Here's what you got:

### 📁 Files Created/Modified

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **`e2e/auth.e2e.spec.ts`** | Main E2E test suite with 11 test cases (TC-001 through TC-011) |
| **`E2E_AUTH_TESTING_GUIDE.md`** | Complete testing guide with examples and best practices |
| **`E2E_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** | Troubleshooting guide specific to ecohubkosova's architecture |
| **`run-e2e-tests.sh`** | Interactive bash script to run tests easily |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Set Test Credentials
```bash
export TEST_USER_EMAIL="test-user@example.com"
export TEST_USER_PASSWORD="TestPassword123!"
```

Replace with actual test user credentials. If you don't have a test user, create one at:
- `http://localhost:3000/sq/register` (while `pnpm dev` is running)

### Step 2: Start Your Dev Server
```bash
pnpm dev
# Runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Run Tests
```bash
# Quick start script (interactive menu)
./run-e2e-tests.sh

# OR run directly
pnpm exec playwright test e2e/auth.e2e.spec.ts
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

Your test suite covers the complete auth flow:

| # | Test Name | What It Tests |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| TC-001 | ✅ Login with valid credentials | User can log in successfully |
| TC-002 | ❌ Login with invalid credentials | Error handling for wrong password |
| TC-003 | 🔐 Access dashboard after login | Protected routes work when authenticated |
| TC-004 | 🚫 Deny unauthenticated access | Middleware blocks unauth users from dashboard |
| TC-005 | 👋 Logout and redirect | User can log out and returns to home/login |
| TC-006 | 🔒 Deny dashboard after logout | Protected routes blocked after logout |
| TC-007 | 🔄 Complete user journey | Full flow: login → browse → logout |
| TC-008 | ⚠️ Empty form validation | Form prevents empty submission |
| TC-009 | 🔗 Session persistence | Session maintained across page navigation |
| TC-010 | 🐢 Slow network handling | Graceful error handling on network issues |
| TC-011 | ⚡ Performance benchmark | Login completes within 10 seconds |

## 🎯 App Structure Context

Based on my analysis of ecohubkosova:

### Auth Routes
- **Login**: `/{locale}/login` (e.g., `/sq/login`, `/en/login`)
- **Register**: `/{locale}/register`
- **Dashboard**: `/{locale}/dashboard` (protected)
- **Home**: `/{locale}` (public)

### Key Components
- **Auth Provider**: `src/lib/auth-provider.tsx`
- **Login Page**: `src/app/[locale]/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
- **Logout Button**: `src/components/layout/header/sign-out-button.tsx` (text: "Dilni")
- **Middleware**: `middleware.ts` (protects `/dashboard`, `/admin`, `/profile`, `/marketplace/add`)

### Authentication
- **Provider**: Supabase
- **Session Versioning**: Custom implementation in `src/lib/auth/session-version.ts`
- **API Route**: `POST /api/auth/signout`

11 passed (42.5s)

## 🔍 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Tests timeout on login
**Solution**: Make sure your test user exists and `pnpm dev` is running
```bash
# Create test user manually at http://localhost:3000/sq/register
# OR check .env.local has SUPABASE credentials
```

### Issue: Sign-out button not found
**Solution**: The button might be in a dropdown menu or has different styling
```bash
# Run in headed mode to see where the button is
pnpm exec playwright test e2e/auth.e2e.spec.ts -g "TC-005" --headed
```

### Issue: Dashboard accessible without login (SECURITY BUG)
**Solution**: Your middleware isn't protecting the route. Check `middleware.ts`:
```typescript
const PROTECTED_PREFIXES = ["/admin", "/dashboard", "/profile", "/marketplace/add"]
```
Must include `/dashboard` ✅

See **`E2E_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** for detailed fixes.

## 🔐 Security Considerations

The tests verify:
- ✅ Only authenticated users access dashboard
- ✅ Session is cleared on logout
- ✅ Protected routes redirect to login when unauthenticated
- ✅ User cannot access other users' data (through session validation)

---

## 📈 Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)
1. ✅ You have the test files
2. Set `TEST_USER_EMAIL` and `TEST_USER_PASSWORD`
3. Run `pnpm exec playwright test e2e/auth.e2e.spec.ts`
4. Share any test failures

### Short-term (This Week)
- [ ] Add data-testid attributes to key elements (makes tests more stable)
- [ ] Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add more protected routes to test coverage
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness (add to playwright.config.ts)

### Long-term (This Month)
- [ ] Expand tests to cover marketplace features
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerts for test failures
- [ ] Document test results

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Use data-testid Attributes
Instead of relying on button text ("Dilni" might change), add:
```tsx
<button data-testid="logout-button">Dilni</button>
```

Then use in tests:
```typescript
signOutButton: '[data-testid="logout-button"]'
```

### 2. Wait for Network Activity
```typescript
// Good: Waits for all network requests
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');

// Fast but risky: Might miss requests
await page.waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded');
```

### 3. Test in Multiple Locales
```typescript
// Update test to test both Albanian and English
for (const locale of ['sq', 'en']) {
  const LOGIN_URL = `/${locale}/login`;
  // ... run test
}
```

### 4. Add Accessibility Tests
```typescript
// Check keyboard navigation
await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
await page.keyboard.press('Enter');

// Check ARIA labels
await expect(page.locator('[aria-label="Log out"]')).toBeVisible();
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: What if I don't have a test user?
**A**: Create one in your app while `pnpm dev` is running:
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/sq/register
2. Fill in the form with test details
3. Note the email and password
4. Use these as `TEST_USER_EMAIL` and `TEST_USER_PASSWORD`

### Q: Can I test with different locales?
**A**: Yes! Update this in `e2e/auth.e2e.spec.ts`:
```typescript
const LOCALE = 'en'; // Change to 'sq', 'fr', etc.
```

### Q: Do I need to test Google sign-in?
**A**: Not with Playwright (OAuth is complex to test). Test manually once, then focus on email/password auth tests.

### Q: How do I run tests in CI/CD?
**A**: See the GitHub Actions example in `E2E_AUTH_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

### Q: What's the performance impact?
**A**: All 11 tests run in ~40-50 seconds locally. In CI with slower machines, expect 1-2 minutes.

## 🚨 Critical Security Checks

The tests verify these security properties:

✅ **Authentication Required**: Dashboard not accessible without login
✅ **Session Isolation**: Each user session is independent  
✅ **Logout Effectiveness**: Session cleared on logout
✅ **CSRF Protection**: Middleware validates requests
✅ **Cookie Security**: Cookies cleared on logout

If any of these fail, you'll see SECURITY ISSUE errors - fix immediately!

---

## 📞 Getting Help

### When tests fail:

1. **Run the diagnostic**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev &
   sleep 3
   curl http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Check logs**:
   ```bash
   # From pnpm dev output, look for errors
   # Check server logs for auth issues
   ```

3. **Run in debug mode**:
   ```bash
   pnpm exec playwright test e2e/auth.e2e.spec.ts -g "FAILING_TEST" --debug
   ```

4. **Share:
   - Test name (TC-001, etc.)
   - Full error message
   - Screenshot from `test-results/`
   - Output from `pnpm dev`
